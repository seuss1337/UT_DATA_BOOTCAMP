# PyBer

## Overview of Project
In this project we're looking to visualize an analysis of PyBer ride data. We
are looking for stats in the rural, suburban and urban cities.

## Results
From the data we can see that PyBer is more popular in Urban areas followed by
suburban and rural as we can see from the number of rides which were 1625, 625 and
125 respectively. Following that trend drivers followed suite with 2405 490 and
78 registered PyBer drivers earning a total of $39854.38, $19,356.33 and $4327.93
in fares. Somthing that stood out was that there was more drivers than actual rides
in urban city types while in rural and suburban we had more rides than drivers which
would be something that we could expect.

One thing that stood out and might be worth looking deeper at was profit per city
type as we found out that average fare per ride was $34.62 for Rural $30.97 for
suburban and $24.53 for urban city types. Drivers of those city types also received
a higher average fare, $55.49 for rural, $39.50 for suburban and $16.57 probably
due to the distances between destinations and perhaps competition between drivers.


## Summary

One recommendation I suggest we look at is the number of drivers that we have in
Urban city types. Is this a data error or is there another explanation like people
are registering as drivers and choosing not to drive or do we have an oversupply of
driver and they're competing amongst each other for rides.

We should also take a look at where the driver is from and where their ride took
place, are drivers driving in different cities? Also if a ride originates from an
rural city and ends in a suburban city how is that recorded.

It would be a good idea to look at idle time for drivers and overall earnings
for a driver. Rural drivers make more per ride, but are they sitting around longer
waiting for a ride most of the day.
