# Employee Database With SQL

## Overview of Project
In this project we are helping management identify the employees that are
nearing retirement age to better prepare for hiring efforts. We will also help
identify employees that are eligible for a mentorship program. We'll be doing this
through SQL Querries.

## Results
- The vast majority of retirings are from Engineering positions
- The vast majority of position types nearing retirement are Senior level positions
- Management is not too affected as only 2 positions are nearing retirement


## Summary


### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

Pewlett Hackard is looking at a total of 90,398 positions to be filled as the
impeding silver tsunami begins to roll in. Of those 90,398 we have 29,414 Senior Engineers,
28,254 Senior Staff, 14222 Engineers, 12243 Staff, 4502 Technique Leaders, 1761 Assistant
Engineers and 2 Manager positions.

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

Currently by Pewlett Packard's standards there is not enough employees to mentor
to replace the retiring employees. By the birthdates we were given of between
January 1956 and the end of December 1965 We have a total of 169 Senior Engineers,
501 Engineers, 1569 Senior Staff 155 Staff 78 Assistant Engineers and 77 Technique
Leaders that qualify for the mentorship program. This amount is a fraction of the
number of employees that are approaching retirement.
