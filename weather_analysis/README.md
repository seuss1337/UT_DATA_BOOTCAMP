# Weather Analysis
## Overview

This project analyzes wather data from variour weather stations in Hawaii. It's
based on python running on jupyter notebooks and the data is pulled using
SQLAlchemy.

## Results
Temperature results were pretty similar between June and December, with most
figures only varying by a few degrees.

- The biggest difference between December and June was the minimum tempterure
  which was 64 degrees in January and 56 degrees in December.

- There was only a difference of 3 degrees between average temperatures of June
and December, it looks like weather is pretty similar throughout the year.

- The standard deviation for both months was less than 4 degrees so it looks like
temperature is pretty stable throughout the months of December and June.

## Summary

Based on the descriptive statistics it looks like temperature wise the weather is
pretty stable and favorable for an icecream eating. However since temperatures are so similar I think we should take other weather variables into consideration
before making a decision. Such variables could include rainfall as regardless of
temperature since most people are not gonna surf with it's raining. I also think
that it's a good idea to identify the dates in which tourism is the highset and
rerun the analysis on those dates.
